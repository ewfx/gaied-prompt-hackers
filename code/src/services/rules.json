  "general_instructions": "When classifying emails, first try to identify keywords related to the 'Request Type'. Once a potential 'Request Type' is identified, look for keywords that might indicate a specific 'Sub Request Type' within that category. If multiple potential Request Types are identified, consider the primary intent of the sender to determine the most appropriate classification. If an email discusses funding (as mentioned in the problem description), and there's no clear indication of it being an outbound movement, classify it as 'Money Movement - Inbound' with a potential sub-request type of 'Timebound' or 'Foreign Currency' if those keywords are present."
